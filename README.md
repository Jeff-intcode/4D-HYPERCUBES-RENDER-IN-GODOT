I'm really sorry for how I uploaded the project, but here are the folders with the evolutionary process of how I ended up creating the first tesseracts in Godot. 
In the original experiment, I only had vertices of the hypercube. 
Later, I managed to make them have edges, and it was very difficult to get them to have faces, but I managed to do it with a green one.

The last time I worked on this, I ended up with a poorly optimized green cube that slowed down the game a lot. 
I tried to do something but couldn't. Also, many scenes and scripts are disposable, since it was me trying to half-fix things I left behind.
